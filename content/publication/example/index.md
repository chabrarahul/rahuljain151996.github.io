abstract: Over the past few years, the use of camera-equipped robotic platforms
  for data collection and visually monitoring applications has exponentially
  grown. Cluttered construction sites with many objects (e.g., bricks, pipes,
  etc.) on the ground are challenging environments for a mobile unmanned ground
  vehicle (UGV) to navigate. To address this issue, this study presents a mobile
  UGV equipped with a stereo camera and a robotic arm that can remove obstacles
  along the UGV’s path. To achieve this objective, the surrounding environment
  is captured by the stereo camera and obstacles are detected. The obstacle’s
  relative location to the UGV is sent to the robotic arm module through Robot
  Operating System (ROS). Then, the robotic arm picks up and removes the
  obstacle. The proposed method will greatly enhance the degree of automation
  and frequency of data collection for construction monitoring. The proposed
  system is validated through two case studies. The results successfully
  demonstrate the detection and removal of obstacles, serving as one of the
  enabling factors for developing an autonomous UGV with various construction
  operating applications.
